CKAN module for Drupal
======

This module provides read-only CKAN integration for Drupal.  It is read only; Drupal will only ever pull information from CKAN.  This code will not attempt to update any CKAN data.

Currently this module provides a text filter for embedding a CKAN resource, as an HTML table, in a Drupal content page.
